This programs functions as an interactive world map that will show you information about countries if you hover a plane over it.

It includes:

An opening screen.
This screen has a 3d sphere that will rotate by pressing the left key and stops by pressing any other key. This was achieved by incrementing the x variable in the camera function, which rotates the view of the sphere without actually rotating the sphere itself. 
It also contains 3 buttons that will light up when hovered over and will change the colour theme of the program when clicked. This function also featured in the main program.

The view screen
After clicking on the start button on the previous screen, the main screen will be called. This screen contains a map and a small plane . If you hover over a country, a function will be called that will find the country that has been hovered over and will call up information and images that has been loaded into the program in setup. It will display this information on the top of the screen. The plane can then fly to another country, and attempts to fly of the map will end in the plane showing up on the other side of the map.
